Think OnlyFans meets Cameo for Sports Training!

Where coaches can sign up for an account to help their athletes (or athletes who find them through the app) through video review, video recording, annotation, and direct messaging.

A coach can watch a video of their golfer taking a swing, and voice-over record fixes while drawing on the video via an annotation tool with straight lines, arrows, body highlighting, and more.

# WHY - Vision & Purpose

## 1. Purpose & Users

- Primary Problem Solved: Bridge the gap between Online coaching and their athletes across the world with video voice over coaching, on screen annotating, and direct messaging.
- Target Users: Coaches who train athletes in fitness and sports
- Value Proposition: Easy to use, way to take your coaching expertise "online" and scale helping athletes online with personalized support with scalable capability. You can get personal help from your favorite coach, influencer, or professional athlete/coach just like cameo is for celebrityies, except this tool is for coaches to help monetize their knowledge and experience. working with athletes worldwide.

# WHAT - Core Requirements

A better, widernet version of CoachNow https://coachnow.io/ / Where players have a social network profile to post their content, get video reviews from coaches/experts, make friends, etc. While Coaches have the ability to help players through free and monetized video reviews, coaching, digital offerings, etc. Coaches will be available in an algorithm players can search to find the ideal coach for them, their sport, their needs. The communication and transctions will live inside the app where the Coach can review videos the player sends, send back slow motion, annotated, voicevoer, upload other videos, send them pdfs and/or training products, and more.

While Coach Now is a fantastic coaching app, it lacks the scalable capability, monetization, and communication capability of Cameo.com for celebrity interaction/video recordings and/or OnlyFans. 

The idea is to bridge these two together underneath a platform that works for all sports, then leverage my network of coaches to build a database of coaches and organic players, THEN run ads to players, and begin to scale quickly.## 2. Functional Requirements

### Core Features

System must:

- Securely allow coaches to login to their own platform where they can see received videos, see direct messages from their coaches, see questions/inquiries from prospective athletes who are looking for coaches. 
- Allow atheltes to create an "athlete" account, set up a profile, navigate and look for coaches in their sport 100% free.
- Allow for players to navigate a coaching databased, built on an algorithm based ranking system, that ranks coaches in the algorithm based on location, matching search criteria, and reviews. 
- Allow for coaches to have active player lists for players that are actviely awaiting video reviews, are recurring members of the coach, or recently received a training video.
- Allow players to easily shoot or upload a video asking questions or making a sports move, doing a workout, etc. The player can upload the video for review where coaches can offer advice for free over comments (with limitations) or send to a paid coach in a direct message for review.
- Allow Coaches to have a feed of players who upload videos to their profiles for review that match the criteria of the coach. 
- Allow players to send coaches videos once uploaded, which notifies the coach and the video will be available for "review" the moment the coach opts in.
- The coach has a series of tools they while watching a video, they can watch the video, and tap record to shoot a "voice over" the video they received, they can draw on the video with the annotiation tool, they can use straight lines, squares, highlight body parts, slow motion, and more. 
- The coach can instantly send the video to the player once they confirm the recording is done, and can also discuss the video with the player over direct messaging.
- Once the response video is reviewed by the coach, and the player receive the response, the player can choose to "respond" with a video, another voiceover over the same video, or send a direct message or other video. 
- The tool is clean, simple to use for both player and coach, the coach can have recurring subscribers stay under a "students" section in DMs, while nn recurring customers are under "One-Off Review", and inquiries from non-paying prospects would come in under "Inquiries"
- Coaches can upload videos and organize them into a "Training System" that they can sell, and/or run a  "group DM" cohort with participating players offeringlive support, or sell as "One Off" products that playeers buy and instantly can access in app to the video package and/or PDF.
- Allow Coaches to sign up for different level of packages that vary from "Free but a high percentage of each sale/membership" up to a higher monthly cost but a lower percentage of each sale/membership. 
- Players can sign up for free but must hire coaches in app, where they can buy access to recurring support, one off video review, DM capability, training programs, PDF ebooks, Cohorts, and/or ongoing recurring memberships. 
- Have Two separate dashboards for Players and Coaches, each with a feed of like-minded posts, the ability to post, the ability to search coaches, send inquiries, or hire them. 
- Coaches must submit drivers license and personal information, and sign an agreement stating they're not felons nor have ever committed a dangerous or crime against women or children. 
- Accept videos/audio in .mp4 / mp3 / .mov/ / .h264 / .flv and/or any other standard video or audio delivery. Codec/compression to make smaller files is fine but can't sacrifice quality of training/advice, which typically takes a clear visual in video review.

### User Capabilities

Users must be able to:

- Securely authenticate using email/password and biometric options, or AuthO options connected to their social media.
- Link and manage multiple financial accounts (bank accounts, paypal to receive funds, as well as these options and Credit Cards to pay fees)
- Easily determine which videos they have received, and in one to two clicks, be able to review and start easily recording a video recording, screen recording, response, or send a video/dm. 
- Be able to respond to players post via "comment" when a video is shown in the coaches feed that meets the criteria they can help with
- Receive notifications when tagged, commented, payment is received, DM is received, or video is reviewed (and any other logical notifications)
- All videos from past students are stored for a set timeframe of 90 Days in app "Locker" after the student is no longer enrolled.  As a student IS enrolled, it's available for as long as they're a paying member for the coach (and the 90 days after). For a player who purchased coaching or a video, their videos are ALWAYS available to them inside of their locker, no matter whether they're paying or not. 
- Coaches and Players can login with AuthO social media accounts
- The screen recording capability is best on mobile with on screen touch button annotation, line drawing, shapes, biomechanic tracking, and text on screen capability, but also is available and works very well on Desktop. 
- Export their financial data in CSV format
- Access email support for technical assistance

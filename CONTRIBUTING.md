## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- Python >= 3.11
- Docker >= 24.0.0
- Kubernetes >= 1.27.x
- Xcode 14.0+ (for iOS)

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### Backend Services
```bash
cd src/backend
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```

#### Web Application
```bash
cd src/web
yarn install
```

#### iOS Application
```bash
cd src/ios
pod install
```

#### Android Application
```bash
cd src/android
./gradlew build
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

### Creating Changes
1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Make changes following platform-specific guidelines
3. Write/update tests to maintain coverage requirements
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit pull request

## Code Standards

### General Guidelines
- Follow language-specific style guides
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Include comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and maintainable
- Use dependency injection where appropriate

### Platform-Specific Standards

#### Backend (Node.js/Python)
- Follow ESLint/Pylint configurations
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow RESTful API design principles

#### Web (React/Next.js)
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper state management
- Follow accessibility guidelines

#### iOS (Swift)
- Follow Swift style guide
- Use SwiftUI when possible
- Implement proper memory management
- Follow Apple HIG guidelines

#### Android (Kotlin)
- Follow Kotlin style guide
- Use Jetpack components
- Implement proper lifecycle management
- Follow Material Design guidelines

# VideoCoach - Professional iOS Sports Training Platform

## Overview
VideoCoach is a professional iOS video coaching platform that enables remote sports training through advanced video analysis, real-time annotations, and secure payment processing. The application is built using Swift and SwiftUI, targeting iOS 15.0 and above.

## Requirements

### Development Environment
- Xcode 14.0+
- iOS 15.0+ SDK
- CocoaPods 1.12.0+
- SwiftGen 6.6.0+
- Ruby 2.7+ (for CocoaPods)

### Dependencies
Key third-party libraries (see Podfile for complete list):
- Socket.IO-Client-Swift v16.1.0 - Real-time communication
- Stripe v23.0 - Payment processing
- Auth0 v2.5.0 - Authentication
- Kingfisher v7.10.0 - Image caching and loading
- Firebase/Analytics v10.18.0 - Analytics and crash reporting
- SDWebImageSwiftUI v2.2.0 - Image loading in SwiftUI
- Starscream v4.0.0 - WebSocket client

## Project Setup

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install development dependencies:
```bash
gem install cocoapods
pod install
```
3. Open VideoCoach.xcworkspace in Xcode
4. Configure signing certificates and development team
5. Set up environment-specific configuration files

### Configuration Files
The project uses three environment configurations:
- Debug.xcconfig - Development environment
- Staging.xcconfig - Testing and QA environment
- Release.xcconfig - Production environment

## Architecture

### MVVM with Combine
The application follows MVVM architecture pattern using Combine framework for reactive programming:

```

```

### Key Features

#### Video Processing Pipeline
- Video capture and compression
- Real-time annotation processing
- Frame extraction for thumbnails
- Voice-over synchronization
- Cloud storage integration

#### Real-time Communication
- WebSocket-based messaging
- Live annotation updates
- Coach-athlete direct messaging
- Session management

#### Security
- SSL pinning
- Secure key storage
- Biometric authentication
- PCI compliance for payments

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
SwiftLint is configured with custom rules for maintaining code quality:
- Line length: 120 characters (warning), 160 characters (error)
- File length: 400 lines (warning), 1000 lines (error)
- Cyclomatic complexity: 10 (warning), 20 (error)
- Custom rules for video processing documentation

### Performance Requirements
- Video processing time: < 60 seconds
- Real-time annotation latency: < 100ms
- App launch time: < 2 seconds
- Memory usage: < 150MB baseline

### Testing
- Unit tests using XCTest
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for video processing
- Network stubbing for offline testing

## Service Integration

### Authentication (Auth0)
```swift
Auth0 Configuration:
- Development: videocoach-dev.auth0.com
- Staging: videocoach-staging.auth0.com
- Production: videocoach.auth0.com
```

### Payment Processing (Stripe)
```swift
Stripe Integration:
- Test Mode: pk_test_...
- Staging: pk_test_staging_...
- Production: pk_live_...
```

### Video Storage (AWS S3)
- Secure upload/download
- CDN integration
- Caching strategy
- Lifecycle management

## Build and Deployment

### Build Configurations
- Debug: Development environment with debugging enabled
- Staging: Pre-production testing environment
- Release: Production environment with optimizations

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated builds via GitHub Actions
- Code signing and provisioning
- TestFlight distribution
- App Store deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. CocoaPods installation errors
2. Signing certificate issues
3. Network connectivity problems
4. Video processing performance

### Debugging Tools
